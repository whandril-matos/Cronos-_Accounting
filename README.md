Website Description
This project is a dynamic landing page developed with a focus on performance, modularity and code reuse, using the following technologies:

🛠 Technologies Used
React – Structures the website in reusable components and maintains the dynamic interface.
Next.js – For better organization and performance when loading the page.
SCSS (Sass) – Used for modular and optimized styling.
TypeScript – Can be integrated for static typing and greater code security.
Reusable Componentization – Each section is structured as an independent component to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
Dynamic Props – Allow easy customization and updating of content without the need for refactoring.
📌 Project Structure
